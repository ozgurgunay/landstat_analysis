Small, reproducible experiments on frequency-domain filtering and geometric transformations for satellite imagery (e.g., Landsat 9). The goal is to see how filtering affects edge/structure visibility and basic feature surrogates.

Requirements

Python 3.9+
Key packages: numpy, scipy, rasterio, scikit-image, matplotlib, pandas
